Image Processing and Vision assignment

## Project description
The project consisted of two parts:
1. Image stitching: Given a sequence of images, the goal was to compose the images into one single panoramic image, as illustrated below.

2. 3D point cloud registration: The goal of this project is to create a 3D reconstruction of a scene from a sequence of images from a depth camera (Kinect, Intel Realsense). This type of camera provides two types of images: a “regular” RGB image (right picture below) and a DEPTH image from which a 3D map can be computed (left picture below).
